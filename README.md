# AMD-OEPNV


The objective of the AMD-OEPNV project is to provide a solution for the first and last mile problems by synchronizing between autonomous micro-mobility services and public transport . To do so, we need to go through 2 main steps:

Data analysis: the objective of this part is to create sound demand scenarios for this new service. In this project, we assumed that from the PT network, only tram network will be considered. We have defined a methodology where we use the GTFS data and origin-destination flow to create origin destination demand requests with the corresponding tram stations that would be used. This methodology could be described by the flow chart in figure 1.

Figure 1: the methodology of demand scenarios creation

For the tram trips extraction, we have used the GTFS data for the tram servicw. We have developed a text-mining algorithm in Python that could read the text files and extract the data needed. We chose to put the algorithm results in excel files as it would be easy to integrate in the simulation model. We generated two excel tables. The first table for the stops Id and their locations. The second table includes the trips ID, the stops of each trip, the arrival and departure time at each stop. For the hourly demand distribution, the starting point was the origin-destination flow table where we have the travel flow between the different regions for each mean of transportation in a statistical day. Assuming that our service would incite 2% of car users to switch to our service, we calculated the number of our customers for each Origin - Destination regions per day. Based on the bike-sharing trip distribution, we extrapolated this demand over the day to get the hourly booking. Using the tram trips file that we generated in the first step, we distribute the hourly requests per region to a random nearest tram station where a tram arrives in that hour. We differentiate between two case: the use for our service for the last mile only or First+Last mile. In the case of First+Last mile, the number of requests for our service will be double the number of requests for last mile only, as the customer will use our service twice: first from their initial location to the tram station and second from the tram station to the final destination. For this case, we have also calculated the duration of the trip for the passenger between the origin and destination region using Dijikstra algorithm and considering the tram trips available at that hour between the two stations (of origin and destination). This was done to ensure that we generate the request for our service in the final tram station at the convenient time respection the duration of travel between the origin tram station and the destination tram station. As output of this step, we generated two excel tables: one for the origin demand where we include the origin region of the customer requests, the number of customers, the origin tram stop Id, and the arrival time of the tram at the origin station, and one for the destination demand where we include the destination region of the customer requests, the number of customers, the destination tram stop Id, and the arrival time of the tram at the destination station.

Synchronization algorithm and evaluation: we developed a distribution algorithm to ensure synchronization between autonomous micro-mobility services (AMD) and the public transportation network. The algorithm evaluates the upcoming demand at each tram station 15 minutes before the tram arrival and calculate the imbalance. If the imbalance is negative and bikes are needed, then we assign the nearest available bikes to the tram station. If no bike is available we do the search again after one minute till a bike is found. This algorithm has been integrated into a simulation model where we represent the key elements of this new services including the trams, the autonomous bikes, the customers, and the stations. As output of the simulation model, we evaluate the service level, the waiting time and the costs distribution. The synchronization algorithm implemented in Anylogic is available in the folder "Synchronisation algorithm".
